PR_11,What is personal information and sensitive personal information under the CCPA?,CCPA,"Under the CCPA: 

""Personal Information"" is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.

The CCPA itself doesn't differentiate ""sensitive personal information"" from ""personal information.""
