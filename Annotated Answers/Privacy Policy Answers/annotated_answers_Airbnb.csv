T_u1,Transparency,What sort of data is collected from me while using this?,"While using Airbnb, the platform collects a wide range of personal information that is integral to providing its services. This includes essential details such as your name, phone number, postal and email address, date of birth, and profile photo, which are necessary for basic account setup and identity verification. Additionally, Airbnb requires payment-related information, including bank account or payment account details, as well as images of government-issued IDs for further identity verification. Users also have the option to provide supplementary profile information, such as gender, language preferences, and personal descriptions. This is complemented by information about other people if you're making bookings on their behalf or sharing travel plans with co-travelers.
