Part 10:
Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible on Airbnb, even after your Airbnb Account is canceled. Because we take measures to protect data from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time. 7. SECURITY While no organization can guarantee perfect security, we are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unlawful or unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration. 8. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time in accordance with applicable law.

In case of material changes, we will also provide you with notice of the modification by email at least thirty (30) days before the effective date.
