Part 4:
We may share personal information of Hosts and Guests with landlords, management companies, homeowners' associations, property owners, and/or property managers (Building Management), such as booking information and information related to compliance with applicable laws, in order to facilitate programs with Building Management. For example, guest booking and personal information, including guest contact information, may be shared with the Building Management of the building, complex, or community where a host lives and/or the listing is located to facilitate hosting services, compliance with applicable laws, security, billing, and other services. 4.7 Host Information Provided to Airbnb for Work Customers. If a booking is designated as being for a business or work purpose and (1) is made by a Guest affiliated with an Enterprise and (2) the Enterprise is enrolled in Airbnb for Work, we may disclose information related to the booking to the Enterprise (e.g., name of the Host, Accommodation address, booking dates, Listing details, etc.) to the extent necessary for the adequate performance of Airbnbs contract with the Enterprise and to provide the services. At the request of the Enterprise or the Guest, we may also share this information with third parties engaged by the Enterprise to provide support services. 4.8 Service Providers. We share personal information with affiliated and unaffiliated service providers (including their service providers) to help us run our business and for their compliance purposes, including those that help us: (i) verify your identity or authenticate your identification documents, (ii) check information against public databases, (iii) conduct background checks, fraud prevention, security investigations, and risk assessments, (iv) perform product development, maintenance, and debugging, (v) allow the provision of the Airbnb Services through third-party platforms and software tools (e.g., through the integration with our APIs), (vi) provide customer service, advertising, or payments services, (vii) offer additional services you select, (viii) process, handle, or assess insurance claims or similar claims, or (ix) review, scan, and analyze communications on the Airbnb Platform for certain purposes (such as evidence of child exploitation). See the Analyzing and Sharing Your Communications section for additional information. These providers are contractually bound to protect your personal information and have access to your personal information to perform these tasks. Other Members can use services other than Airbnb to process your data. These can include email or reservation management software. Such services are outside of Airbnbs control and will be subject to applicable laws around the world with varying levels of data protection. 4.9 Business Transfers. If Airbnb undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer, or share some or all of our assets, including your information in connection with such transaction or in contemplation of such transaction (e.g., due diligence). In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 4.10 Corporate Affiliates. To support us in providing, integrating, promoting and improving the Airbnb Platform, Payment Services, and our affiliates services, we may share personal information within our corporate family of companies that are related by common ownership or control. Some examples are: Sharing with Airbnb, Inc. Even if your country of residence is not the United States, your information will be shared with Airbnb, Inc., which provides the technical infrastructure for the Airbnb Platform. Sharing with Airbnb Payments. In order to facilitate payments on or through the Airbnb Platform, certain information as described in the Outside of the United States section will be shared with the relevant Airbnb Payments entity.

Sharing with Airbnb GSL. Even if your country of residence is not Japan, your information may be shared with Airbnb GSL, which provides customer support and other business operation services to other Airbnb entities. Sharing with Airbnb China. If you (i) created a Listing in China, (ii) inquired about or booked a Host Service located in China, or (iii) sent a message to a Host in relation to that Hosts listing in China, information you provided was shared with Airbnb China as described in the prior version of this Privacy Policy. Similar to other hospitality or short-term rental companies that do business in China, Airbnb China may disclose your information to Chinese government agencies without further notice to you. Your information may be further shared with service providers (including in China) to help run our business. Our service providers may also disclose your information where required by law. 5. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION 5.1 Third-Party Partners Integrations. Parts of Airbnb may link to third-party services. Airbnb does not own or control these third parties. When you interact with these third parties and choose to use their service, you are providing your information to them. Your use of these services is subject to the privacy policies of those providers, including Google Maps/Earth Additional Terms of Use, Google Privacy Policy (see here for more information on how Google uses information), Paypal Privacy Statement, and Citi Privacy Policy. 6. YOUR RIGHTS You can exercise any of the rights described in this section consistent with applicable law. See here for information on data subject rights requests and how to submit a request.

If you connected your Airbnb Account to a third-party service, like Facebook or Google, you can change your settings and unlink from that service in your Account settings. You are responsible for keeping your personal information up to date. 6.2 Data Access and Portability. In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request certain copies of your personal information or information about how we handle your personal information, request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and/or request that we transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible). 6.3 Data Erasure. In some jurisdictions, you can request that your personal information be deleted. Please note that if you request deletion of your personal information, or if your account is suspended, terminated, or voluntarily closed: We may retain your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as prevention of money laundering, fraud detection and prevention, and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend an Airbnb Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain information from that Airbnb Account to prevent that Member from opening a new Airbnb Account in the future. We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Airbnb and Airbnb Payments may keep information for tax, legal reporting, and auditing obligations. Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) may continue to be publicly visible on Airbnb, even after your Airbnb Account is canceled. Because we take measures to protect data from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time. 7. SECURITY While no organization can guarantee perfect security, we are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unlawful or unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration. 8.
