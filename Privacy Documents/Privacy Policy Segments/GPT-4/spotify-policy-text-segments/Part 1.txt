Tailored advertising controls What is tailored advertising? This is when we use information about you to tailor ads to be more relevant to you. This is also known as interest based advertising or cross-context behavioral advertising. An example of tailored advertising is when an advertising partner has information suggesting you like cars. This could enable us to show you ads about cars. How to control tailored advertising: You can control tailored advertising in your account Privacy Settings under Tailored Ads. You can also control tailored advertising for some podcasts using the link in the episodes show description. This applies where the content provider inserts advertising into the podcast to fund it. The hosting provider, which might not be Spotify, manages these controls for the podcast. If you are opted out of Tailored Ads in your Privacy Settings, you may still get advertising. This can include on our free Service Option, as well as our paid Service Option, as applicable (for example, advertising in podcasts). This type of advertising is based on your registration information and what you are currently listening to on our services. For example, if you are listening to a cooking podcast, you may hear an ad for a food processor.
