III. Data collections and uses A. The data we collect Uber collects data: provided by users to Uber, such as during account creation created during use of our services, such as location, app usage, and device data from other sources, such as other users or account owners, business partners, vendors, insurance and financial solution providers, and governmental authorities For your convenience, weve provided a visual summary of the data we collect and how we use it here. Uber collects the following data: 1. Data provided by users. This includes: User profile information: We collect data when users create or update their Uber accounts, or place orders via guest checkout features. This may include their name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information), drivers license and other government issued documents (which may include identification numbers as well as birth date, gender, and photo). This also includes vehicle or insurance information of drivers and delivery persons, emergency contact information, user settings, and evidence of health or fitness to provide services using Uber apps. Background check information (drivers and delivery persons): This includes information submitted during the driver/delivery person application process, such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law), license status, known aliases, prior addresses, and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on Ubers behalf. Identity verification photos: This includes photos of users (such as, selfies) and/or their government issued identifications (such as, drivers license or passports). Such photos may be used to verify a users identity, such as through facial verification technologies. Please see the section titled How we use personal data for more information regarding how user photos are used for safety and security purposes, including identity verification. Demographic data: We may collect demographic data about users, such as birth date/age, gender or occupation, when required for certain Uber services or programs, such as Uber Cash, alcohol deliveries or safety features that allow women users to set a preference to provide or receive services to/from other women (Women Rider Preference). We may also infer demographic data from other data collected from users. For example, we may infer a users gender based on their first name to enable safety features, such as the Women Rider Preference, or to display personalized ads for third party products or services. See the section titled How we use personal data below for more information. We may also collect demographic data through user surveys. User content: We collect the data submitted by users when they contact Uber customer support (including at Uber Greenlight Hubs or via phone chat or video conferencing tools), provide ratings or feedback for other users, restaurants or merchants, or otherwise contact Uber. This may include photographs, or audio or video recordings submitted by users in connection with a customer support request. This also includes metadata relating to the method you use to communicate with Uber. The contents of photos and recordings submitted by users are subject to Ubers Community Guidelines. In certain jurisdictions, users can record the audio and/or video of their trips through an in-app feature or using a dashcam. In app recordings are encrypted and stored on users devices, and are only shared with Uber if submitted by the users in connection with safety incidents. Please see here for more information. Travel information: We collect travel itinerary information, including times and dates of upcoming flight, lodging or car rental reservations, from users of our Uber Travel feature. We collect such information: (i) when users manually input their information into their Uber Travel itinerary; or (2) if authorized by users to access their Gmail accounts, from travel-related email confirmations. If so authorized, Uber will only access users Gmail accounts to collect travel itinerary information to enable the Uber Travel feature, and will adhere to Googles API Services User Data Policy, including the limitations on use of data collected from users Gmail accounts. 2. Data created during use of our services. This includes: Location data (driver and delivery person): We collect precise or approximate location data from drivers and delivery persons mobile devices when the Uber app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen). Location data (riders and order recipients). We collect precise or approximate location information from riders and order recipients mobile devices if they enable us to do so via their device settings. Uber collects such data from the time a ride or order is requested until it is finished, and any time the app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen). See Choice and transparency below for information on how riders and order recipients can enable precise location data collection. Riders and order recipients may use the Uber apps without enabling collection of location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect certain features in the Uber apps. For example, a rider who has not enabled precise location data will have to manually enter their pickup address. In addition, precise location data collected from a drivers device during a trip is linked to the riders account, even if the rider has not enabled precise location data to be collected from their device. This data is used for purposes such as receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation. Transaction information: We collect transaction information related to the use of our services, including the type of services requested or provided; trip or order details (such as date and time, requested pick-up and drop off addresses, distance traveled and items ordered); and payment transaction information (such as a restaurants or merchants name and location, amount charged, and payment method). We also associate a users name with that of anyone who uses their promotion code. Usage data: We collect data about how users interact with our services. This includes access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, browser type, and app crashes and other system activity. Device data: We collect data about the devices used to access our services, including the hardware models, device IP address or other unique device identifiers, operating systems and versions, software, preferred languages, advertising identifiers, device motion data, and mobile network data. Communications data: We collect data regarding phone, text or in-app communications between users that are enabled through Ubers apps.

We may also collect the content of phone calls solely where users are notified in advance that the call may be recorded. 3. Data from other sources.
