B. How we use personal data Uber uses data to enable reliable and convenient transportation, delivery, and other products and services. We also use such data: to enhance the safety and security of our users and services for customer support for research and development to enable communications between users for marketing and advertising to send non-marketing communications to users in connection with legal proceedings For your convenience, weve provided a visual summary of the data we collect and how we use it here. We use the data we collect: 1. To provide our services. Uber uses data to provide, personalize, maintain, and improve our services. This includes using data to: create/update accounts. enable transportation, delivery and other services/features, such as: using location data to navigate rider pick-ups and order drop-offs, calculate ETAs, and track the progress of rides or deliveries. features that involve data sharing, such as sharing driver first name and vehicle information with riders to facilitate pick-ups, user profile and trip details for ETA sharing and fare splitting, and user ratings and compliments. match available drivers and delivery persons to users requesting services. Users can be matched based on availability, location/proximity, user settings/preferences and other factors such as likelihood to accept a trip based on their past behavior or preferences. Please see here for further information about our matching process. features that facilitate use of our services by those with disabilities. features that involve account linking, such as linking of email to create Uber Travel itineraries and linking of rewards programs to enable partnership benefits (such as with Marriott Bonvoy). enable dynamic pricing, in which the price of a ride, or the delivery fee for Uber Eats orders, is determined based on factors such as estimated time and distance, predicted route, estimated traffic, and the current number of users requesting or providing services. process payments. personalize users accounts. For example, we may present an Uber Eats user with personalized restaurant or food recommendations based on their prior orders. facilitate insurance, vehicle, invoicing, or financing solutions. provide users with trip or delivery updates, generate receipts, and inform them of changes to our terms, services, or policies. perform necessary operations to maintain our services, including to troubleshoot software bugs and operational problems. Uber performs the above activities on the grounds that they are necessary to fulfill the terms of our agreements with users, are compatible with such uses, or on the grounds that they are necessary for purposes of Ubers and its users legitimate interests. 2. Safety and security. We use data to help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our services and users. This includes: verifying users identity and eligibility to provide transportation or deliveries, including through reviews of background checks, to help prevent use of our services by unsafe drivers and/or riders. In certain regions, this includes Ubers Real-Time ID Check feature, which prompts drivers and delivery persons to share a selfie before going online to help ensure that the driver or delivery person using the app matches the Uber account we have on file. We may also use this feature for other verification purposes such as verifying change of bank account information or regaining account access. In addition, we may use facial recognition technology to process user profile photographs, identification photographs, or other user-submitted photographs to prevent identity-borrowing or use of our services by unauthorized drivers or delivery people. We may also use selfies to verify that users are wearing masks, helmets or other safety gear through the use of object verification technology. In some countries, riders may be required to verify their identity to use cash and certain other payment methods. In such cases, Uber allows riders to provide their ID number and/or a photo of their identification card to complete such verifications. Please see here for more information about rider identity verification. Similarly, order recipients may be required to provide their age and an image of their government issued identification to verify their eligibility to order and receive alcohol deliveries. Please see here for more information about order recipient identity verification. using data from drivers or delivery persons devices to detect unsafe driving behavior such as speeding or harsh braking and acceleration, and to inform them of safer driving practices. We also use data from delivery persons devices to verify the type of vehicles they used to provide deliveries. using driver location information, and communications between riders and drivers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud. For example, if we determine that a driver is delaying a rider pickup in order to induce a cancellation, we will not charge the rider a cancellation fee and will adjust the amounts paid to the driver to omit such a fee. To object to such an adjustment, please contact Uber customer support. using device, location, user profile, usage, and other data to prevent, detect, and combat other types of fraud. This includes identifying fraudulent accounts or uses of our services, preventing use of our services by unauthorized drivers or delivery persons, verifying user identities in connection with certain payment methods, and preventing and combating unauthorized access to users accounts. In some cases, such as when a user is determined to be abusing Ubers referral program or has submitted fraudulent documents, such behavior may result in automatic deactivation, or in the European Union or where otherwise required by law, deactivation after human review. To object to such a deactivation, please contact Uber customer support. using user ratings, reported incidents, and other feedback to encourage compliance with our Community Guidelines and as grounds for deactivating users with low ratings or who otherwise violated such guidelines in certain countries. In the European Union or where otherwise required by law, such deactivation occurs only after human review and/or the possibility to appeal. For more information about how ratings are determined and used, please see here for rider ratings, here for driver ratings, and here for delivery person ratings. To object to such a deactivation, please contact Uber customer support. using driver data (such as location, ratings and gender where legally permitted) and rider data (such as ratings, origin and destination) to predict and help avoid pairings of users that may result in increased risk of conflict (for instance, because one user previously gave the other a one-star rating). sharing user name, location, phone number, vehicle details and other relevant information with third-party companies that support the management and de-escalation of interpersonal conflicts that may occur between users while on a trip or in the process of making a delivery.
