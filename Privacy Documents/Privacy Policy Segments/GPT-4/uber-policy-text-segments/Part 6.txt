Device permissions Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without the device owners permission, and these platforms have different methods for how that permission can be obtained. Please check the available settings on your device or check with your provider. C. In-app ratings pages After every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5. An average of those ratings is associated with a users account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services. For example, rider ratings are available to drivers from whom they request transportation, and driver ratings are available to their riders. This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and riders. Riders can see their average rating in the main menu of the Uber app, and also access a breakdown of their average rating in Ubers Privacy Center. Drivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in the Uber Driver app. Click here for more information.
